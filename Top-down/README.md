# CCDR ANALYTICAL NOTEBOOKS
## Multi-hazard risk screening based on global/regional datasets

--------------------------------------

## OVERVIEW
This is an open tool for risk screening based on globally-avaialble datasets. 

The ‘top-down’ approach offers analytical notebooks allowing non-experts to perform comprehensive, multi-hazard risk screening using regionally available and comparable datasets. The work under this tier is characterized by: 

 - Global and regional-scale data inputs 
 - User-friendly, and easily interpretable tools and outputs
 - Some degree of customisation, but ensuring transferability and comparability between countries 

Analysis runs over high resolution exposure data (90 m) and is then aggregated at the required administrative level. This approach provides sub-national mapping of natural hazards, exposure and risk,  which can inform policy and targeted interventions. Risk is calculated independently for each individual hazard.

## CONTENT

   - **[Procedures](procedures/)** - explains the analytical workflow used by notebooks with examples for different hazards
   - **[Notebooks](notebooks/)** - include jupyter notebooks to perform the spatial analytics for each hazard
   - **[Parallelization](parallelization/)** - include python scripts (beta) to perform the spatial analytics with better efficiency for each hazard
