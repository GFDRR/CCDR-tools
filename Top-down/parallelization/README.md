## ToDo List

- Code has been tested and is working on Linux; need to test on Mac and Windows
- On Windows, preliminary tests do not allow for parallelization. More info on a similar issue [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18204782/runtimeerror-on-windows-trying-python-multiprocessing).
- The results generated by this script need to be validated against the current version in operation.
