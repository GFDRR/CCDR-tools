# CCDR ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

## RISK BASELINE (historical period)
Two metrics can be calculated depending on the availability of proper impact functions:

   - **[Expected Annual Impact (EAI)](Analytical_procedure_function.md)** - when hazard is expressed as multiple return periods and impact function is available for the selected exposure categories
   - **[Expected Annual Exposure (EAE)](Analytical_procedure_classes.md)** - when hazard is expressed as individual or multiple return periods and no impact function is available for the selected exposure categories, risk is classified according to hazard intensity intervals (classes)

--------------

## RISK OUTLOOK (projections)
 
   - **[Projections](projections/)** - A set of extreme climate indices are accounted to estimate the change in climate-related hazards.
