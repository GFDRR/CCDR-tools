# Country Climate & Disaster Risk Screening Tools

## Overview

A collection of scripted tools developed alongside the World Bank's [Country Climate and Development Report](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/country-climate-development-reports) (CCDR) risk screening activities (2022/2025).

The tool allows to:
- Perform sub-national disaster risk analysis based on global datasets (Floods, Tropical Cyclones, Custom Hazard).
- Combine risk and poverty information into bivariate maps
- Extract climate anomaly and timeseries information by administrative units
- Present results into a dashboard

Please refer to the online [**DOCUMENTATION**](https://gfdrr.github.io/CCDR-tools/).
