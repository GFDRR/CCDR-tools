# CCDR ANALYTICAL NOTEBOOKS
A collection of Python notebooks to perform country-level climate and disaster risk analysis based on global data.

- **Top-down**: multi-hazard risk screening based on global/regional datasets for selected country and administrative level.
  - [Flood](https://github.com/GFDRR/CCDR-tools/blob/main/Top-down/notebooks/Flood.ipynb): uses flood model (multiple return periods) to calculate:
	1) Expected Annual Impact (EAI) over population (mortality) and built-up (physical damage) according to vulnerability functions;
	2) distribution of exposed categories (population, built-up or agricultural land) across hazard classes.


  - Heat stress:
  - Drought:
  - Landslide:
  - Tropical cyclones:
  - Air Pollution:

- **Bottom-up**: hazard-specific, detailed risk evaluation based on mix of regional and local data
