# CCDR ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES

These documents describe the workflow behind the **[Notebooks](../notebooks/)**

## RISK BASELINE (historical period)
Two metrics can be calculated depending on the availability of proper impact functions:

   - **[Expected Annual Impact (EAI)](Analytical_procedure_function.md)** - when the hazard component is framed as multiple return periods and impact function is available for the selected exposure categories
   - **[Expected Annual Exposure (EAE)](Analytical_procedure_classes.md)** - when the hazard component is framed as individual or multiple return periods and no impact function is available for the selected exposure categories, risk is classified according to hazard intensity intervals (classes)

--------------

## RISK OUTLOOK (projections)
 
   - **[Projections](projections/)** - A set of extreme climate indices are accounted to estimate the change in climate-related hazards by evaluating the anomaly (standard deviation) of hazard-related climate indices for a specified future time horizon over the reference period.
