# CCDR ANALYTICAL NOTEBOOKS
## Multi-hazard risk screening based on global/regional geodatasets

--------------------------------------

## OVERVIEW
This is an open tool for risk screening based on globally-avaialble datasets. For more details see full online [**DOCUMENTATION**](https://gfdrr.github.io/CCDR-tools).

--------------------------------------

## RATIONALE

The applied methodology centers around the concept of Risk. In the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM), risk (R) is typically calculated as a function of: the hazard occurrence probability and intensity (i.e., physical magnitude) in a particular location (H, for Hazard); the people and physical assets (infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc.) situated in that location and therefore exposed to the hazard (E, for Exposure); and the conditions determined by physical, social, and economic factors which increase the susceptibility of an exposed individual, community, asset or system to the impacts of hazards (V, for Vulnerability).
Following this established approach, the risk originating from hazard affecting exposed categories is defined as: `R = f(H,E,V)`
