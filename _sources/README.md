# ANALYTICAL TOOLS FOR RISK SCREENING & ASSESSMENT

## OVERVIEW
A collection of tools to:
- perform subnational disaster risk analysis based on global datasets
- combine risk and poverty information
- produce climate outlook
- present results into dashboard

## RATIONALE

In the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM), risk (R) is typically calculated as a function of: the hazard occurrence probability and intensity (i.e., physical magnitude) in a particular location (H, for Hazard); the people and physical assets (infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc.) situated in that location and therefore exposed to the hazard (E, for Exposure); and the conditions determined by physical, social, and economic factors which increase the susceptibility of an exposed individual, community, asset or system to the impacts of hazards (V, for Vulnerability).
Following this established approach, the risk originating from hazard affecting exposed categories is defined as: `R = f(H,E,V)`
