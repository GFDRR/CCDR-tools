# Climate & Disaster Risk Screening Tools

A collection of scripted tools developed alongside the World Bank's [**Country Climate and Development Report**](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/country-climate-development-reports) risk screening activities (2022/2023).

The tools collected in this repository allow to:

- Perform disaster risk analysis at sub-national level based on global datasets
- Combine risk and poverty information
- Produce climate outlook
- Present results into a dashboard

As an example of the output produced using these tools, check some of the risk screening reports produced (2022/2023):

- [**Nigeria**](Top-down/reports/NGA_RSK.pdf)
- [**OECS countries**](Top-down/reports/OECS_RSK.pdf)

## Disaster risk framework

In the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM), risk (R) is typically calculated as a function of: the hazard occurrence probability and intensity (i.e., physical magnitude) in a particular location (H, for Hazard); the people and physical assets (infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc.) situated in that location and therefore exposed to the hazard (E, for Exposure); and the conditions determined by physical, social, and economic factors which increase the susceptibility of an exposed individual, community, asset or system to the impacts of hazards (V, for Vulnerability).

Conceptual framework of Disaster Risk as a combination of an hazard (described by intensity in relation to its occurrence frequency or probability) occurring in the same location of Exposed asset or capital (which can include population, built-up asset, or else) which is vulnerable to suffer impact from that specific hazard.

The **UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (GAR)** is the flagship report of the United Nations on worldwide efforts to reduce disaster risk. The GAR is published by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and is the product of the contributions of nations, public and private disaster risk-related science and research, amongst others.
