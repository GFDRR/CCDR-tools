# Exposure

The concept of exposure relates to the receptors of risk, which are the physical, human and production capitals that could be loss due to natural hazards.

```{seealso}
**The situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas (UNDRR 2017).**

Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of interest.

**Exposure data** can include a variety of indicators that are used to represent the value exposed to a disaster impact. In this sense, any data representing a potential receptor of risk can be considered exposure data.
In this tools, the standard exposure indicators include:

For the purpose of the standard risk screening, these indicators are collected in form of raster datasets representing the presence or density for each one.
