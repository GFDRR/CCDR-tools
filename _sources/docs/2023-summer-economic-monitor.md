# 2023 Summer Economic Monitor Insights

In addition to broadening our understanding of key economic sectors, the Syria Economic Monitor 2023 summer update also looks at economic impacts of  the February 6 earthquake in Turkiye and northern Syria, which affected the livelihoods of thousands of people and caused cascading economic disruption. 

Support for this edition of the Monitor includes use of alternative data to better understand changing trends in:

* Maritime-based trade using AIS transponder data

* Agricultural productivity through remote sensing

* Changing centers of economic activity, as observed through mobility data and nighttime lights

* Environment - deforestation, air quality, and GHG emissions - through remote sensing

* Movement between Turkiye and Syria. 

The following sections represent sample insights and analytics, prepared for use by the Syria Economic Monitor team and intended to be combined with other resources and local knowledge to create a complete understanding of the changing economic conditions in this fragile county. Datasets and methods for all insights are presented in the previous sections.
