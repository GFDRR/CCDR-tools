# Impact and risk

In the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM), risk (R) is typically calculated as a function of: the hazard occurrence probability and intensity (i.e., physical magnitude) in a particular location (H, for Hazard); the people and physical assets (infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc.) situated in that location and therefore exposed to the hazard (E, for Exposure); and the conditions determined by physical, social, and economic factors which increase the susceptibility of an exposed individual, community, asset or system to the impacts of hazards (V, for Vulnerability).

```{seealso}
**Disaster risk is expressed as the likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time (UNDRR 2017).**

Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of interest.

## Hazard and exposure combinations

The following matrix show the combinations of hazard and exposure for which a vulnerability model is provided, and the type of model, allowing to express the risk either in form of impact (damage) or exposure to hazard classes.

## Probability of impact

When probabilistic hazard scenarios (multiple layers by Return Period) are available to describe hazard intensity in relation to their occurrence frequency, a mean estimate of Expected Annual Impact (EAI) over exposed categories can be calculated.

## Annual risk baseline

Baseline refers to the historical period to which the data refer.

- The EAI is calculated by multiplying the impact from each scenario with its exceedance probability, and then summing up to obtain the mean annual risk considering the whole range of hazard occurrence probabilities. The exceedance frequency curve highlights the relationship between the return period of each hazard and the estimated impact: the area below the curve represents the total annual damage considering all individual scenario probabilities.

- The EAE is calculated by multiplying the exposure to each hazard scenario with its exceedance probability, and then summing up to obtain the mean annual risk considering the whole range of hazard occurrence probabilities for a range of hazard thresholds.

### Lower and Upper bounds

Originally, the calculation of EAI was performed using the customary approach, as exempliefied [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7878c89c592e4a78b45f03b4b696ccac) and [CIT].
