# Exposure Datasets

**Exposure Datasets** refer to a variety of datasets that can be used to represent the value that is exposed to suffer damage and losses from natural hazards.
This section presents some of the most common and recent type of data and indicators used for this purpose.

Where feasible, all datasets that can be obtained through the Development Data Hub have been placed in a special collection: [Risk Data Library Collection: EXPOSURE](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=exposure&start=0&sort=){target="_blank"}.

## Sample Indicators

**Indicators** can be derived from a combination of **Foundational Datasets** and **Data Products**. By combining Foundational Datasets and Data Products, teams can, on-demand, develop a large array of indicators to meet their project needs. Indicators can presented side-by-side in an Excel workbook -- a format that is generally accessible to the widest audiences.  Because all indicators are based on the same underlying data, they are comparable with each other, across geographies and across time.

For this project, sample indicators have been derived and aggregated at the governorate level and by year, to show changing trends in each governorate over time. Here is a link to the **Indicators Excel workbook** (accessible to team members via SharePoint): [Excel workbook](https://worldbankgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/DevelopmentDataPartnershipCommunity-WBGroup/EXZkY4Z6vMVMjRVcIBCHqlkBVI4z1b9rP1fyyLQ6aluvWA?e=pFazxV), and following is a summary of sample indicators.
