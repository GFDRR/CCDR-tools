# Risk Data Library

The [**Risk Data Library**](https://riskdatalibrary.org) project led by GFDRR grew out of in-depth Disaster Risk Management community consultation on improving access to risk information.
Its overarching purpose is to support disaster resilience work by making risk data easier and more effective to work with.

RDL proposes a standard... `FILL IN`

Most of these **Risk Datasets** can be obtained through the [World Bank data catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org), specifically in the [**Risk Data Library Collection**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/collections/rdl).
