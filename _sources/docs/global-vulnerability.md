# Vulnerability Datasets

**Vulnerability Datasets** refer to a variety of datasets that can be used to represent the value that is exposed to suffer damage and losses from natural hazards.
This section presents some of the most common and recent type of data and indicators used for this purpose. Vulnerability data are usually the most difficult piece to collect: not all hazards are described appropriately by existing vulnerability studies; and many V models are propietary (e.g. part of complex catastrophy disaster models) instead of open data, and as such, they are often left unshared within a project output.

```{seealso}
Vulnerability datasets developed by WB disaster risk projects have been placed in a special collection of the WB Development Data Hub: [Risk Data Library Collection: **VULNERABILITY**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=vulnerability&start=0&sort=).
```

Below is a quick link to openly-available vulnerability models and data that are used by the CCDR standard screening tool.

## Additional datasets

Additional sources of impact models are [under review](https://github.com/GFDRR/rdl-standard/issues/29).
