# Natural hazards

Natural (or physical) events are only termed hazards when they have the potential to harm people or cause property damage, social and economic disruption. The location of natural hazards primarily depends on natural processes, including the movement of tectonic plates, the influence of weather systems, and the existence of waterways and slopes (e.g. that might generate landslides). But processes such as urbanization, environmental degradation and climate change can also influence the location, occurrence (frequency) and intensity of natural hazards. These processes are known as risk drivers.

**A hazard is a process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. Hazards may be natural, anthropogenic or socionatural in origin (UNDRR 2017).**

**Natural Hazard Data** include hazard intensity datasets and the models (code) or approaches that are used to produce them. Hazard intensity modelling can be either:

- Deterministic, in the form of an individual geodata layer measuring the mean, median or maximum intensity of a hazard aggregating historical data and modelling. This is the case for landslide and drought hazard.

- Probabilistic, in the form of multiple geodata layers, each representing a range of hazard physical intensities (e.g. water depth [m], wind speed [km/h]) corresponding to a specific occurrence frequency, measured as Return Period (RP), in years. This is the case for river flood, coastal flood and strong winds.

**Raw hazard data (model output) usually come in the form of one or more georeferenced layers.**

```
See the picture below as example: the landslide hazard (first map) is represented by one aggregated mean index value; while the flood hazard is shows as a series of events (scenarios) of increasing magnitude and decreasing probability.

```{caution}
Note that a return period of 1,000 years, while very unlikely, can occur anyday! Therefore it is important to consider all range of probabilities when assessing risk.

Hazard models carry **limitations related to their applicability**. Their quality depend on scale, resolution, model quality, training period and related input data quality.
As a rule of thumb, their fitness for application in the context of a risk screening or assessment exercise depends on the scale of the risk analysis, i.e. locally-sourced models are expeceted to be best fitted for local scale assessment (e.g. city level), while global models are best suited for national or sub-national estimates.

In the context of developing countries, however, a global model is the only available source of hazard data for a location. In those cases, the application of the global model must be taken with caution and correctly interpreted acknowledging the limitations.

When it comes to natural hazards and risk, **misinformation can be worse than no information at all**.
