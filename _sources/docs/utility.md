## Merge tiles

Large raster datasets often comes as a collection of regular tiles.
In order to run the raster analysis offered in our tools, they often need to be merged into one file.
To do that, a simple python script is provided as jupyter notebook.

[Download it](../utility/merge_tiles/Merge_tiles.zip) on your computer and run it in the same python environment as the other CCDR tools.
