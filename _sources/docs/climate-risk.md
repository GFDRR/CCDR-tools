# Climate outlook

Hydro-meteorological hazards are affected by climate.

The forward-looking analysis makes use of climate projections to explore how environmental risks could develop spatially over time.
The assessment of future impacts of climate change are based on comparisons of baseline conditions (which can be either observed or simulated) against future scenarios of climate variability. The long-term averages of climate variables serve as the baseline conditions. Changes in projected values against this baseline are then interpreted future climate anomalies and used to project forward-looking disaster risks.

Given that specific unit of measurement varies across climate indices, all changes against the baseline are expressed in terms of Standard Deviation (SD) of the anomaly compared to historical variability (E3CI, 2020). Data from climate models released under the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR) framework (IPCC 2021a) are used to establish estimates of baseline and future projected climate anomalies. ARs are supported by coordinated climate modeling efforts referred to as Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP). The analysis relies on CMIP6 data for modeling into the future, and takes into account four climate change scenarios, referred to as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in CMIP6. These pathways cover the range of possible future scenarios of anthropogenic drivers of climate change by accounting for various future greenhouse gas emission trajectories, as well as a specific focus on carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration trajectories (IPCC 2021b). The following scenarios are included in this analysis:

- SSP1/RCP2.6: emissions peak between 2040 and 2060, declining by 2100. This results in 3-3.5 °C of warming by 2100.
- SSP2/RCP4.5: emissions continue to increase through the end of the century, with resulting warming of 3.8-4.2 °C.
- SSP3/RCP7.0: models describe a large emission variability for this scenario. Warming in 2100 is estimated at 3.9-4.6 °C.
- SSP5/RCP8.5: high emissions scenario resulting in warming of 4.7-5.1 °C.

Each climate scenarios predicts different spatial patterns, resulting into a range of possible futures in terms of intensities, and frequencies of natural hazards. Key climate variables connected to the changing patterns of precipitation and temperature are collected from Copernicus Data Store and summarized in Table 2.
