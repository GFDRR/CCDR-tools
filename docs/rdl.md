# Risk Data Library

The [**Risk Data Library**](https://riskdatalibrary.org) project led by GFDRR grew out of in-depth Disaster Risk Management community consultation on improving access to risk information.
Its overarching purpose is to support disaster resilience work by making risk data easier and more effective to work with.

Building on GFDRR experience, extensive & intensive review of risk literature and case studies, and partnership with some of the main risk data actors ([GEM, UCL EPICentre, BGS, OasisHUB and more](https://riskdatalibrary.org/project)), the RDL proposes a standard data and metadata schema to organise, format, describe, store and share risk data.

More information are available in the [**RDL documentation**](https://rdl-standard.readthedocs.io).

The [**Risk Data Library Collection**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/collections/rdl) is a catalogue where **Risk Datasets** produced or used by World Bank analytics are stored and organised by the [**RDL standard metadata schema**](https://docs.riskdatalibrary.org/en/latest/reference/browser/).
