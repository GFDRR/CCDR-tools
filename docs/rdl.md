# Risk Data Library

The [**Risk Data Library**](https://riskdatalibrary.org) project led by GFDRR grew out of in-depth Disaster Risk Management community consultation on improving access to risk information.
Its overarching purpose is to support disaster resilience work by making risk data easier and more effective to work with.
Most of these **Risk Datasets** can be obtained through the WB Development Data Hub, being collected into the [**Risk Data Library Collection**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/search/collections/rdl) within the World Bank Data catalogue.
