| [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) | GNU | STAC catalogue | Geodata exchange portal |
```

The Planetary Computer combines a multi-petabyte catalog of global environmental data with intuitive APIs, a flexible scientific environment that allows users to answer global questions about that data, and applications that put those answers in the hands of researchers and stakeholders.

```{note}
There is a nice [**QGIS plugin**](https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin/) that allows you to directly get data in the software.
