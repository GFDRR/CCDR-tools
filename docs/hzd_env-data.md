## Air pollution

Air pollution can be measured by the mean annual surface-level concentrations of PM2.5, which is available from 1998 to 2020 [[van Donkelaar et al, 2021](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/#V5.GL.02)] at 1.1km spatial resolution. This dataset combines data from different sources, including NASA MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS observations with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model into a high-resolution map of air pollution. The dataset combines both human-induced PM2.5 emissions, emitted, for instance, by car engines, power plants, as well as fireplaces and biomass burning [[NCRD 2014](https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/particulars-pm-25#:~:text=PM%202.5%20comes%20primarily%20from,crazy%20central%20and%20southern%20California.)] and natural sources of PM2.5, which include forest fires and desert dust [[McDuffie et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23853-y#:~:text=Sources%20include%20direct%20emissions%20such,primary%20gas%2Dphase%20pollutant%20precursors.)]. These fine particles, smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, pose enormous health risks as they can lodge deeply into the lungs [[WHO 2019](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-11-2019-what-are-health-consequences-of-air-pollution-on-populations#:~:text=Exposure%20to%20high%20levels%20of,people%20who%20are%20already%20ill.)].

Concentrations of PM2.5 over 15 Î¼g/m3 can lead to severe public health consequences (respiratory infections, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer), especially in densely populated areas. While not a climate hazard in and of itself, air pollution can be affected by climate change [[UCAR 2022](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/air-quality/air-quality-and-climate-change#:~:text=Because%20of%20climate%20warming%2C%20the,more%20often%20in%20hot%20temperatures.)], but can also affect local climate: drier conditions can promote dust transport from soil; wildfires can increase the local dust concentration; high dust can alter the heat intake from the sun and thus affect temperatures.
