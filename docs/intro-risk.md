# Impact and risk

In the field of Disaster Risk Management (DRM), risk (R) is typically calculated as a function of: the hazard occurrence probability and intensity (i.e., physical magnitude) in a particular location (H, for Hazard); the people and physical assets (infrastructure, buildings, crops, etc.) situated in that location and therefore exposed to the hazard (E, for Exposure); and the conditions determined by physical, social, and economic factors which increase the susceptibility of an exposed individual, community, asset or system to the impacts of hazards (V, for Vulnerability).

```{seealso}
**Disaster risk is expressed as the likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period of time (UNDRR 2017).**

Measures of exposure can include the number of people or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks associated with that hazard in the area of interest.

## Determimistic and probabilistic risk

While historical losses can explain the past, they do not necessarily provide a good guide to the future; *most disasters that could happen have not happened yet*. Probabilistic risk assessment simulates those future disasters which, based on scientific evidence, are likely to occur. As a result, these risk assessments resolve the problem posed by the limits of historical data. Probabilistic models therefore "complete" historical records by reproducing the physics of the phenomena and recreating the intensity of a large number of synthetic events.

```{note}
In the context of disaster risk, probability refers to the frequency of occurrence or the return period of losses associated with hazardous events.
```

**Probabilistic risk** is the chance of something adverse (impact) occurring. This method assesses the likelihood of an event(s) and it contains the idea of uncertainty because it incorporates the variability between frequent, low impact events and rare, high impact events.

In contrast, a **deterministic risk** model typically models one scenarios, representing a real event or an individual, finite risk scenario (e.g. mean, median, worst case), but does not quantify the variability around it.
 
When probabilistic hazard scenarios (multiple layers by Return Period) are available to calculate impacts in relation to occurrence frequency, an estimate of the Expected Annual Impact (EAI) over exposed categories can be calculated.

## Annual risk baseline

Baseline refers to the historical period to which the data refer.

- The EAI is calculated by multiplying the impact from each scenario with its exceedance probability, and then summing up to obtain the mean annual risk considering the whole range of hazard occurrence probabilities. The exceedance frequency curve highlights the relationship between the return period of each hazard and the estimated impact: the area below the curve represents the total annual damage considering all individual scenario probabilities.

- The EAE is calculated by multiplying the exposure to each hazard scenario with its exceedance probability, and then summing up to obtain the mean annual risk considering the whole range of hazard occurrence probabilities for a range of hazard thresholds. Risk is then expressed *as exposure to hazard over a certain threshold*.

### Lower and Upper bounds

Originally, the calculation of EAI was performed using the customary approach, as exemplified [here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7878c89c592e4a78b45f03b4b696ccac) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334005888_A_global_multi-hazard_risk_analysis_of_road_and_railway_infrastructure_assets).

## Supported Hazard and exposure combinations

The following matrix show the combinations of hazard and exposure for which a vulnerability model is provided, and the type of model, allowing to express the risk either in form of impact (damage) or exposure to hazard classes.
