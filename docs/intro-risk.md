## Probability of impact


## Annual risk

- The EAI

- The EAE is calculated by multiplying the exposure to each hazard scenario with its exceedance probability, and then summing up to obtain the mean annual risk considering the whole range of hazard occurrence probabilities for a range of hazard thresholds.
