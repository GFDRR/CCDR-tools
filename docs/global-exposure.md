# Exposure Datasets

**Exposure Datasets** refer to a variety of datasets that can be used to represent the value that is exposed to suffer damage and losses from natural hazards.
This section presents some of the most common and recent type of data and indicators used for this purpose.

Exposure datasets developed by WB disaster risk projects have been placed in a special collection of the WB Development Data Hub: [Risk Data Library Collection: **EXPOSURE**](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search?q=exposure&start=0&sort=).

Below is a quick link to openly-licensed datasets that are used by the CCDR standard screening tool.

## Additional datasets

For a more detailed analysis, additional exposure datasets can be considered. 

For this project, sample indicators have been derived and aggregated at the governorate level and by year, to show changing trends in each governorate over time. Here is a link to the **Indicators Excel workbook** (accessible to team members via SharePoint): [Excel workbook](https://worldbankgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/DevelopmentDataPartnershipCommunity-WBGroup/EXZkY4Z6vMVMjRVcIBCHqlkBVI4z1b9rP1fyyLQ6aluvWA?e=pFazxV), and following is a summary of sample indicators.
